Mobile App Signup Flow, Email Template, and Restaurant Menu UI/UX
Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources for three UI/UX design tasks:

Mobile App Signup Flow

Secure: The form is designed to ensure secure input handling.
Error-Free: Includes validation to reduce errors.

Visually Appealing: Carefully selected fonts, colors, and images ensure a pleasant aesthetic experience.
Easy to Use: A clean and intuitive layout ensures customers can quickly find their desired dishes.
Categorized: The menu is organized into categories for easier navigation.
